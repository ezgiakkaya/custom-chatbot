# 🤖 Custom Chatbot with OpenAI API and Python LangChain 🐍

Welcome to my custom chatbot project, where the future of conversational AI meets creativity and innovation! 🚀🌟

## Overview 📘

This project is a custom chatbot built using the powerful OpenAI API, embeddings, and Python LangChain. It's designed to provide interactive and intelligent responses to user queries. 💬🧠

## Key Features 🌟

- **OpenAI API Integration**: Leverage the cutting-edge GPT models for generating human-like text. 🤯
- **Embeddings**: Utilize embeddings for understanding and processing language efficiently. 📚
- **Python LangChain**: Harness the power of LangChain for advanced language processing capabilities. 🔍
- **Interactive UI**: Engage with the chatbot through a user-friendly interface. 💻

## Technologies 🛠️

- OpenAI API
- Python LangChain
- Node.js and Vite for the backend and development server
- JavaScript for frontend interaction

## How It Works 🤔

1. **User Input**: The chatbot receives user queries through the web interface.
2. **Processing**: Queries are processed using Python LangChain and embeddings to understand context and intent.
3. **Response Generation**: The OpenAI API generates a relevant and coherent response.
4. **Display**: The response is displayed to the user in the web interface.

## Running the Project 🚀

1. Clone the repo: `git clone [your-repo-link]`.
2. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the server: `npm run dev`.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser to interact with the chatbot.

## Roadmap 🗺️
